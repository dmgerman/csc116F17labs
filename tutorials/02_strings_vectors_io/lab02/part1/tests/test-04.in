C++ is often considered to be a superset of C,
but this is not strictly true.
Most C code can easily be made to compile
correctly in C++, but there are a few differences
that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave
differently in C++.
For example, C allows implicit conversion from void*
to other pointer types, but C++ does not (for type safety
reasons).
Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class,
which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names)
in a C program.
