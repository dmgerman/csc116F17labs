God loves his children, God loves his children, yeah!
The panic, the vomit
The yuppies networking
The dust and the screaming
The crackle of pigskin
You're leaving
That's it, sir
From a great height... height...
From a great height
Come on rain down on me
Rain down, rain down
I guess he does....
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
You don't remember
Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
When I am king, you will be first against the wall

What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
