Calling Constructors:
p0: Point [0, 0]
p1: Point [1, 1]
p2: Point [5.9, 0.2]
p3: Point [0, 0]
p4: Point [0, 0]
p5: Point [3, 2]
Performing Operations:
p3  =  p1: p3 = Point [1, 1]
p4  = -p1: p4 = Point [-1, -1]
p5 +=  p2: p5 = Point [8.9, 2.2]
p1 + p3 = Point [2, 2]
p1 * 2  = Point [2, 2]
Computing Distances:
Distance between p0 and p1 is 1.41421
Distance between p3 and p4 is 2.82843
Distance between p4 and p3 is 2.82843
